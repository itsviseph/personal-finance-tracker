# Personal Finance Tracker CLI

A command-line personal finance tracker built using Python.  
This project allows users to record income and expenses, calculate balances, and analyze spending by category.

The goal of this project is to practice **Python fundamentals**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and building a small but realistic CLI application.

- Understand where money is being spent
- Compare income vs expenses
- Practice Python CLI application development

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Input validation (handle invalid user input safely)
- Save and load data using JSON or CSV
- Monthly summaries and reports
- Unit tests
- Web-based interface in the future
